I am Valentina Chinnici: a passionate, value-driven Product Manager with experience leading the development of complex digital and physical products & kits for STEAM Education, Maker Education, and B2B SaaS. 

### Where I work

I am currently Sr Product Marketing Manager for BEE Content design Inc. Previously I worked at Arduino as Product Manager. In my previous role, I was responsible for defining the roadmap, and product milestones, as well as managing the backlog on JIRA. I do also worked on the product lifecycle as well as the go-to-market strategy in collaboration with the marketing team (I have a strong background in marketing). Although I believe the most exciting part of my job is to identify the _Jobs to be done_, and listening to the customers’ needs. 

I contributed to open-up a new market segment (middle school) expanding the product portfolio with the [Arduino Science Kit Physics Lab](https://store.arduino.cc/physics-lab): an educational kit which combines custom-made hardware, and firmware, based on the Arduino WiFi 1010 board, a dedicated CMS to host content (available in 6 languages) as well as additional learning/teaching materials, a BLE integration for the Google’s Science Journal App. I managed everything from competitors’ analysis, to the concept up until the deployment to the market by the announced deadline. 

To make the development possible I work across different internal teams (from Hardware to Firmware, and Software, to supply chain, etc.).

Outline requirements. | Work cross-teams to build products that consistently combine compelling design, smooth interactions, functional code, streamlined production. | Test prototypes with final users. Iterate and improve. | Communicate. Create a compelling narrative for the customers. Create visuals for launch campaign. 

### Portfolio

#### Arduino Science Kit Physics Lab

Developed in partnership with Google, the Arduino Science Kit Physics Lab is an Arduino-based physics lab, fully compatible with Google Science Journal available on Android.

##### Goal
Create a simple, affordable, out-of-the-box experience for Science teachers, teaching Physics. Open up a new Education Segment (middle school).

##### Challenges
Opening up a new segment market provided a series of challenges, starting from the curriculum requirements, to the health and safety compliance, as well as online privacy for kids (COPPA COMPLIANCE). 

#### Approach
We used a Kanban/Waterfall approach to manage the development of the hardware. Then an agile approach for content, design, and the software integration for Android. 
We came up with an integrated approach which is combining: custom-made hardware and assembly pieces, content for the teachers and students alike, and a custom integration for the open-source mobile platform to check the progress of the data stream (Google Science Journal). 
We setup rapid prototype sessions in conjunction with the activities content outlines. Hardware was following according to the iterative findings as we developed the product.

##### Idea Management
I started researching on the way teachers were using Arduino in the classroom, in order to figure out if there were new ways of promoting Arduino in a classroom setting. Arduino was already largely used in high-schools and universities as datalogger tool, or cheaper alternative to expensive lab equipment. One of the best example to this was the workshop led by Professor Organtini, University La Sapienza in Rome, with his "Arduino and the smartphone" lab. 
We decided to allow younger kids to experiment sciences with a more affordable approach, simple to integrate in the curriculum with guidelines to map lessons to regular curriculum, and easy for the teacher to setup. The kit was mapped with NGSS and UK National Science Curriculum.

##### Specifications
The Arduino Science Kit had some pretty clear software specifications: the Android integration worked over BLE therefore we had to build a protocol and a Firmware that could communicate easily and reliably. 
We used a custom approach for the firmware, using a protocol similar to Firmata.

##### Delivery
The delivery of the Arduino Science Kit was coordinated between Arduino & Google. We worked closely with Google's engineers, as well as our development team to deploy the Android integration on time, and review the codebase to be integrated seamlessly in the official Google Science Journal app available on the store.

I love traveling and knowing local people. 

I have recently discovered a passion for hiking and I do that with my tiny dog Aldi (yes, the same name as the supermarket). 

From time to time I do some hand modelling for some of our products.

I instituted a safe space for mental health in the workplace as a response to the current Covid-19 pandemic, providing colleagues with selected personal and mental wellbeing articles, healthy check-ins reminders, and promoting the importance of a positive workplace culture. I have also started an [Instagram account in Italian](https://www.instagram.com/scrignofelice/) to support people who struggle with mental health.
